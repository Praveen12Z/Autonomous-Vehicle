# Autonomous-Vehicle
This is the first project of the KV Introduction to autonomous vehicles

### Project Overview
This section should contain a brief description of the project and what you are trying to achieve.

### Set up
This section should contain a brief description of the steps to follow to run the code.

### Dataset
Dataset analysis
This section should contain a quantitative and qualitative description of the dataset. It should include images, charts, and other visualizations.

- Coco dataset will be used

### Dataset preparation
This section should detail your dataset preparation strategy (pre-processing, data augmentation) and justify your approach.

### Training
In this section, you must explicitly explain your training process and the code to perform it.

- YOLO algorithm will be used

### Reference experiment
This section should detail the results of the reference experiment where you use your selected model in the selected dataset WITHOUT training. It should include training metrics and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performances.

### Improve on the reference
This section should detail the results of the reference experiment where you use your selected model in the selected dataset AFTER training. It should include training metrics and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performances.
